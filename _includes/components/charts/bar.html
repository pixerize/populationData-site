Because the "bar" visualization is basic, not too much needs to be done here,
apart from providing the canvas tag and supporting graph limits. For details on
the Chart.js configuration being used, see `createPlot()` in `indicatorView.js`.
We also check for "graph_stacked_disaggregation" here to support stacked bars.
